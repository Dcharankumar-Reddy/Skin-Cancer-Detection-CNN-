To convert this project into code, we'll focus on implementing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for skin cancer detection using the HAM10000 dataset. This will involve several steps:

Data Preparation: Load and preprocess the HAM10000 dataset.
Model Creation: Build a CNN model.
Training: Train the model on the dataset.
Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance.
Prediction: Make predictions on new data.
Here's a step-by-step implementation using Python and TensorFlow/Keras:
