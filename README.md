### Skin Cancer Detection By Using CNN
## CNN = Convolutional neural network
# Steps:
- Data Preparation: Load and preprocess the HAM10000 dataset.
- Model Creation: Build a CNN model.
- Training: Train the model on the dataset.
- Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance.
- Prediction: Make predictions on new data.
- Here's a step-by-step implementation using Python and TensorFlow/Keras
- And finally Developed a CNN Model Based on Skin Cancer detection model with 89%of Accuarcy.
This project is Completely based on image recognition technique,and required more amount of data to analyze the images.



Successfully Completed the Smartinternz Industrial Certification Course ,demonstrating comprehensive knowledge of AI And Ml principles.
